Hello, Welcome to my blog.

The name's Red. I usually named myself as it if I go to online forums or discussion (heck my GitHub account name was assigned to that name)

if you want to go to my landing portofolio & my urls, you can visit :
[here](https://isoletslicer.github.io). this blog is dedicated to my random thoughts.

I rarely express myself. I don't like anything and a few things that I like.

I do some meditation, controlling myself, reading, listening music, and sleeping.

If you insisted me to tell me what's I like, maybe I can give you only these things : [Steel Ball Run](https://jojowiki.com/Steel_Ball_Run), [Synchro Summoning](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon), and [Prime Knight](https://grandchase.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Knight).

> "Heheheheheheh... So you're here to pick a fight with a legend?"
> -- Prime Knight
